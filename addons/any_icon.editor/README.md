# AnyIcon: type and class icons utility

![Addon's icon](/icon.svg)

A utility singleton providing an easy way to get the icon of any value (Node, custom class, bool, int...)

This is **not** a GUI, it's a GDScript utility. If you look for a GUI to 
look up editor icons, you may want to use
[Godot Editor Theme Explorer](https://github.com/YuriSizov/godot-editor-theme-explorer).



## Features / How to use

The main method provided by [AnyIcon](addons/any_icon.editor/any_icon.gd)
is `get_variant_icon(any_value: Variant)`. It's a static method that returns
the icon associated with the passed value. It can handle any value, from built-in
types (bool, int, Packed\*Array), to custom classes with `@icon("path")` specified.

There are more specific methods too, that you can use if you already know if the value
you pass is a built-in type, a built-in class or a custom class.

Every method accepts an optional `fallback` parameter,
which is the name of the icon that will be fetched from the `"EditorIcons"`
theme type in case no icon is found for a type
(this is very unlikely to happen, since all types are covered and classes
will at least inherit `Object` and thus it's icon)

You can look at the documentation generated by Godot for more information.
(By default: `F1` then search for `AnyIcon`.)



## Installation

You can download the addon:
- On GitHub: `Code` → `Download ZIP`.
- Through the editor: `AssetLib` → Search for "AnyIcon"

You can exclude `*.editor/*` or `any_icon.editor/` from your export presets,
because this addon is editor-only.

## Godot version

Godot version: 4.3+

Note: In 4.3, there will be a few warnings at installation due to script UIDs that were introduced in 4.4.

Won't work with 4.2 due to missing methods required by this addon.
